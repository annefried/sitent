Steve - 

Thanks for your comments.  You needn't convince me; I've been involved with the MIME charset issue for a long time (you'll note that I am one of the authors of the ISO-2022-JP spec).  In defense of the other Pine team members, the sin is one of omission rather than of comission; they wanted to do something about character sets and didn't want to wire in a table of legal values (since it might change). 

I've suggested that as a first pass the charset should only be settable in the system config file, and that the charset always be coerced to US-ASCII unless the text contains 8-bit characters and/or has ``funny'' control characters such as ESC or SI/SO.  More work would definitely be needed in this area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just now...
