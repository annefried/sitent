Vince, 

I agree with you that it's a lesson people need to learn over and over again.  I can't tell you how many politicians I met over the past year who really don't like markets and certainly don't understand how or why they work.  These aren't just the minor leaguers in Sacramento, but the big league players in Washington. 

I also agree that the academic community can play "an important role in shaping public opinion and in explaining the logic of deregulation process."  I'd like to think that is in large part what I have been trying to do.
