Mathematica's parsing, which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes, has no problem handling complex embellishments. 

I can see value in allowing prefix and postfix operators to act as operator embellishments, for instance to add accents to operators or to change their relative size, or position. 

If these embellishment prefix and postfix operators have a high precedence and hence bind tightly to the adjacent operator then I don't see any problems. Am I missing something?
