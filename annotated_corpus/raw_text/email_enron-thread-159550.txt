Kim: I have completed the invoices for April, May and June and we owe Pasadena each month for a total of $3,615,910.62. I am waiting to hear back from Patti on May and June to make sure they are okay with her. Do you want me to pay Pasadena on Friday for these months or do you want me to hold off until I finish July and August? Again, I do not have all of the information for July and August, so I cannot give you any numbers. If I go by what is currently in the system as a guide, Pasadena would owe Enron a little over $1 mil. I need to forecast the money today, so please let me know what you would like to do. FYI-I will be out of the office all next week. Megan

Thanks you so much for working on these as fast as you have - there was a priority in getting them out. However, as you know, the less cash outlay that we have right now the better. Lets wait and try to offset the amount we owe them with what they owe us - so I say wait until you get July and August done. What do you think the time frame is on this? And when would be the earliest that we would make the payment? Thanks, Kim

Patti is the one with the details, I'm just the deal maker and don't have access to any of the systems. All I know is what fixed priced baseload deals we have. I have no idea what flows. I hope Patti can help you soon. Let me know if you don't hear from her today.

If I can get all of the information today, I can tell you this afternoon. It doesn't take long to create the calc sheets. I understand from Janine that you or Patti can provide me with the detail that I need. If necessary, I can come pick it up. I have sent Patti a list. For payment, we have to forecast the money two days out. So, if I know today, I can pay on Friday. Megan
