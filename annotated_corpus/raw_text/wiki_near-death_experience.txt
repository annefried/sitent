A near-death experience (NDE) is a personal experience associated with impending death, encompassing multiple possible sensations including detachment from the body, feelings of levitation, total serenity, security, warmth, the experience of absolute dissolution, and the presence of a light. 38%-50% of the American Adult population who come close to clinical death have had a near-death experience.

Explanatory models for the NDE can be divided into several broad categories, including psychological, physiological, and transcendental explanations. Research from neuroscience explains the NDE in terms of various physiological and psychological factors, while some NDE researchers in the field of near-death studies advocate for a transcendental explanation.

The equivalent French term exp√©rience de mort imminente (experience of imminent death) was proposed by the French psychologist and epistemologist Victor Egger as a result of discussions in the 1890s among philosophers and psychologists concerning climbers' stories of the panoramic life review during falls. In 1968 Celia Green published an analysis of 400 first-hand accounts of out-of-body experiences. This represented the first attempt to provide a taxonomy of such experiences, viewed simply as anomalous perceptual experiences, or hallucinations. These experiences were popularized by the work of psychiatrist Raymond Moody in 1975 as the near-death experience (NDE).

Researchers have identified the common elements that define near-death experiences. Bruce Greyson argues that the general features of the experience include impressions of being outside one's physical body, visions of deceased relatives and religious figures, and transcendence of egotic and spatiotemporal boundaries. Many common elements have been reported, although the person's interpretation of these events often corresponds with the cultural, philosophical, or religious beliefs of the person experiencing it.

Another common element in near-death experiences is angels. 46% of Americans believe in angels, and have claimed to see them during their NDE's. This is particularly true for patients in a clinical setting.

Even though no single feature is found in every NDE, the traits that have been reported by NDErs are as follows:

* A sense/awareness of being dead.
* A sense of peace, well-being and painlessness. Positive emotions. A sense of removal from the world.
* An out-of-body experience. A perception of one's body from an outside position. Sometimes observing doctors and nurses performing medical resuscitation efforts.
* A "tunnel experience" or entering a darkness. A sense of moving up, or through, a passageway or staircase.
* A rapid movement toward and/or sudden immersion in a powerful light (or "Being of Light") which communicates with the person.
* An intense feeling of unconditional love and acceptance.
* Encountering "Beings of Light", "Beings dressed in white", or similar. Also, the possibility of being reunited with deceased loved ones.
* Receiving a life review, commonly referred to as "seeing one's life flash before one's eyes".
* Receiving knowledge about one's life and the nature of the universe.
* Approaching a border, or a decision by oneself or others to return to one's body, often accompanied by a reluctance to return.
* Suddenly finding oneself back inside one's body.

Kenneth Ring (1980) subdivided the NDE on a five-stage continuum. The subdivisions were:
# Peace
# Body separation
# Entering darkness
# Seeing the light
# Entering the light

He stated that 60% experienced stage 1 (feelings of peace and contentment), but only 10% experienced stage 5 ("entering the light").

Clinical circumstances associated with near-death experiences include cardiac arrest in myocardial infarction (clinical death); shock in postpartum loss of blood or in perioperative complications; septic or anaphylactic shock; electrocution; coma resulting from traumatic brain damage; intracerebral hemorrhage or cerebral infarction; attempted suicide; near-drowning or asphyxia; apnea; and serious depression. In contrast to common belief, Kenneth Ring argues that attempted suicides do not lead more often to unpleasant NDEs than unintended near-death situations.

===NDE variants===

Some NDEs have elements that bear little resemblance to the "typical" near-death experience. Anywhere from one percent (according to a 1982 Gallup poll) to 20 percent of subjects may have distressing experiences and feel terrified or uneasy as various parts of the NDE occur, they visit or view dark and depressing areas or are accosted by what seem to be hostile or oppositional forces or presences.

Persons having bad experiences were not marked by more religiosity or suicidal background. According to one study (Greyson 2006) there is little association between NDEs and prior psychiatric treatment, prior suicidal behavior, or family history of suicidal behavior. There was also little association between NDEs and religiosity, or prior brushes with death, suggesting the occurrence of NDEs is not influenced by psychopathology, by religious denomination or religiosity, or by experiencers' prior expectations of a pleasant dying process or continued postmortem existence. Greyson (2007) also found that the long term recall of NDE incidents was stable and did not change due to embellishment over time.
