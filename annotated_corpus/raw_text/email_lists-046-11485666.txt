I'll mail this out while it's fresh in my head: 

The  document 
http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Math/Group/Wolfram/general.html
contains the following statement which I completely disagree with (at least as stated here). 

Rendering into other media (such as speech) is expected to communicate, essentially, a "mental picture" of the 2-dimensional form of an expression. (Rationale: since almost all mathematics is conventionally expressed in 2-dimensional graphical form, most notations in that medium have no standard version in other media.) 

Reason I disagree: 

Renderings in speech need to convey more than a "2D picture" of the expression.  Check out (listen to ) some of the demos on my AsTeR WWW site-- they make the point about spoken renderings being *independent* of the visual 2D layout far better than I am capable of in a plain-text email message. 

Given that the contentious statement appears in our "rationale"  document, I thought it sufficiently importatn to have clarified.
