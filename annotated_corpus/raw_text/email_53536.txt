Have you considered joining a consultancy?

Bill, 

Lacima is relatively small, but they have two very competent and experienced principals: Chris Strickland and Les Clewlow. 

I am looking right now at a number of options. Hopefully, I shall make a decision within a few weeks.

Have you developed plans?  I'd be interested in your evaluation of Lakima Group, whom I believe you've worked with.  How big are they?

Hi Vince - Its very sad to see what has happened.  I hope you are doing OK under the circumstances.  I wanted also to let you know that I'm transitioning to an advisory role at Opt4  since they are now in a more operational mode, rather than developmental.  I've joined Charles River Associates in the Palo Alto office. What are your plans for the future?  I would like to extend an invitation to get to know us better, and perhaps to collaborate if our interests coincide.  When do you get back from vacation?
