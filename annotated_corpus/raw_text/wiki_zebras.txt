Zebras (/ˈzɛbrə/ ZEB-rə or /ˈziːbrə/ ZEE-brə)[1] are several species of African equids (horse family) united by their distinctive black and white stripes.
Their stripes come in different patterns, unique to each individual.
They are generally social animals that live in small harems to large herds.
Unlike their closest relatives, horses and donkeys, zebras have never been truly domesticated.

There are three species of zebras: the plains zebra, the Grévy's zebra and the mountain zebra.
The plains zebra and the mountain zebra belong to the subgenus Hippotigris, but Grévy's zebra is the sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus.
The latter resembles an ass, to which it is closely related, while the former two are more horse-like.
All three belong to the genus Equus, along with other living equids.

The unique stripes of zebras make them one of the animals most familiar to people.
They occur in a variety of habitats, such as grasslands, savannas, woodlands, thorny scrublands, mountains, and coastal hills.
However, various anthropogenic factors have had a severe impact on zebra populations, in particular hunting for skins and habitat destruction.
Grévy's zebra and the mountain zebra are endangered.
While plains zebras are much more plentiful, one subspecies, the quagga, became extinct in the late 19th century – though there is currently a plan, called the Quagga Project, that aims to breed zebras that are phenotypically similar to the quagga in a process called breeding back.

==Etymology==
The name "zebra" in English dates back to c.1600, from Italian zebra, perhaps from Portuguese, which in turn is said to be Congolese (as stated in the Oxford English Dictionary).
The Encarta Dictionary says its ultimate origin is uncertain, but perhaps it may come from Latin equiferus meaning "wild horse"; from equus ("horse") and ferus ("wild, untamed").
The word was traditionally pronounced with a long initial vowel, but over the course of the twentieth century, the pronunciation with the short initial vowel became the usual one in the UK and Commonwealth.
The pronunciation with a long initial vowel remains standard in the United States.

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Zebras evolved among the Old World horses within the last 4 million years.
Grévy's zebras (and perhaps also Mountain Zebras) are, together with asses and donkeys, in a separate lineage from other zebra lineages.
This means either that striped equids evolved more than once, or that common ancestors of zebras and asses were striped and only zebras retained the stripes.
Extensive stripes are posited to have been of little use to equids that live in low densities in deserts (like asses and some horses) or ones that live in colder climates with shaggy coats and annual shading (like some horses).

Fossils of an ancient equid were discovered in the Hagerman Fossil Beds National Monument in Hagerman, Idaho.
It was named the Hagerman horse with a scientific name of Equus simplicidens.
It is believed to have been similar to the Grévy's zebra.
The animals had stocky zebra-like bodies and short, narrow, donkey-like skulls.
Grévy's zebra also has a donkeylike skull.
The Hagerman horse is also called the American zebra or Hagerman zebra.

===Classification===

There are three extant species.
Collectively, two of the species have eight subspecies (seven extant).
Zebra populations are diverse, and the relationships between, and the taxonomic status of, several of the subspecies are not well known.
* Genus: Equus
** Subgenus: Hippotigris
*** Plains zebra, Equus quagga
**** †Quagga, Equus quagga quagga (extinct)
**** Burchell's zebra, Equus quagga burchellii (includes Damara Zebra)
**** Grant's zebra, Equus quagga boehmi
**** Selous' zebra, Equus quagga borensis
**** Chapman's zebra, Equus quagga chapmani
**** Crawshay's zebra, Equus quagga crawshayi
*** Mountain zebra, Equus zebra
**** Cape mountain zebra, Equus zebra zebra
**** Hartmann's mountain zebra, Equus zebra hartmannae
** Subgenus: Dolichohippus
*** Grévy's zebra, Equus grevyi

The plains zebra (Equus quagga, formerly Equus burchelli) is the most common, and has or had about six subspecies distributed across much of southern and eastern Africa.
It, or particular subspecies of it, have also been known as the common zebra, the dauw, Burchell's zebra (actually the subspecies Equus quagga burchellii), Chapman's zebra, Wahlberg's zebra, Selous' zebra, Grant's zebra, Boehm's zebra and the quagga (another extinct subspecies, Equus quagga quagga).

The mountain zebra (Equus zebra) of southwest Africa tends to have a sleek coat with a white belly and narrower stripes than the plains Zebra.
It has two subspecies and is classified as vulnerable.

Grévy's zebra (Equus grevyi) is the largest type, with a long, narrow head, making it appear rather mule-like.
It is an inhabitant of the semi-arid grasslands of Ethiopia and northern Kenya.
Grévy's zebra is the rarest species, and is classified as endangered.

Although zebra species may have overlapping ranges, they do not interbreed.
In captivity, plains zebras have been crossed with mountain zebras.
The hybrid foals lacked a dewlap and resembled the plains zebra apart from their larger ears and their hindquarters pattern.
Attempts to breed a Grévy's zebra stallion to mountain zebra mares resulted in a high rate of miscarriage.
In captivity, crosses between zebras and other (non-zebra) equines have produced several distinct hybrids, including the zebroid, zeedonk, zony, and zorse.
In certain regions of Kenya, plains zebras and Grévy's Zebra coexist, and fertile hybrids occur.

==Physical attributes==

===Size and weight===

The common plains zebra is about 50–52 inches (12.2–13 hands, 1.3 m) at the shoulder with a body ranging from 6–8.5 feet (2–2.6 m) long with an 18-inch (0.5 m) tail.
It can weigh up to 770 pounds (350 kg), males being slightly bigger than females.
Grévy's Zebra is considerably larger, while the mountain zebra is somewhat smaller.

===Stripes===
It was previously believed that zebras were white animals with black stripes, since some zebras have white underbellies.
Embryological evidence, however, shows that the animal's background color is black and the white stripes and bellies are additions.
It is likely that the stripes are caused by a combination of factors.

The stripes are typically vertical on the head, neck, forequarters, and main body, with horizontal stripes at the rear and on the legs of the animal.

A wide variety of hypotheses have been proposed to account for the evolution of the striking stripes of zebras.
The more traditional of these (1 and 2, below) relate to camouflage.

1.
The vertical striping may help the zebra hide in grass by disrupting its outline.
In addition, even at moderate distances, the striking striping merges to an apparent grey.

2.
The stripes may help to confuse predators by motion dazzle—a group of zebras standing or moving close together may appear as one large mass of flickering stripes, making it more difficult for the lion to pick out a target.

3.
The stripes may serve as visual cues and identification.
Although the striping pattern is unique to each individual, it is not known whether zebras can recognize one another by their stripes.

4.
Experiments by different researchers indicate that the stripes are effective in attracting fewer flies, including blood-sucking tsetse flies and tabanid horseflies.
A 2012 experiment in Hungary showed that zebra-striped models were nearly minimally attractive to tabanid horseflies.
These flies are attracted to linearly polarized light, and the study showed that black and white stripes disrupt the attractive pattern.
Further, attractiveness increases with stripe width, so the relatively narrow stripes of the three living species of zebras should be unattractive to horseflies.

===Gaits===
Like horses, zebras walk, trot, canter and gallop.
They are generally slower than horses, but their great stamina helps them outpace predators.
When chased, a zebra will zig-zag from side to side, making it more difficult for the predator.
When cornered, the zebra will rear up and kick or bite its attacker.

===Senses===
Zebras have excellent eyesight.
It is believed that they can see in color.
Like most ungulates, the zebra has its eyes on the sides of its head, giving it a wide field of view.
Zebras also have night vision, although not as advanced as that of most of their predators.

Zebras have excellent hearing, and tend to have larger, rounder ears than horses.
Like horses and other ungulates, zebras can turn their ears in almost any direction.
In addition to eyesight and hearing, zebras have an acute sense of smell and taste.

===Diseases===
Being an equid, Zebras are subject to many of the common diseases of the domestic horse.

*Parasites:
::Equid intestinal roundworms parascaris sp.
and strongylus vulgaris 
::Roundworms of the lungs
::Botfly larvae in the stomach
::Lice
::Mange
::Ticks, which can serve as vectors for other diseases such as Babesia
*Salmonella bacterial infection of the intestine
*Pneumonia and pleuritis
*Acute heart lesions due to stress
*Tetanus and anthrax: In northern Kenya in 2005–2006, an outbreak of anthrax affected Grevy's Zebra; 53 Grevy's and 26 Plains Zebras died.
620 Grevy's Zebras were vaccinated to halt the spread.

Two Grevy's Zebras were poisoned in 1995 by leaves of a hybrid red maple tree (acer rubrum) at the St. Louis Zoo.
Horses were first reported in 1981 to be susceptible; even small amounts of red maple leaves can be toxic to ponies.
In 2000 a zebra was first reported infected with a nematode, halicephalobus, known to infect horses and usually associated with decaying plant material.

==Ecology and behavior==

===Harems===

Like most members of the horse family, zebras are highly social.
Their social structure, however, depends on the species.
Mountain zebras and plains zebras live in groups, known as 'harems', consisting of one stallion with up to six mares and their foals.
Bachelor males either live alone or with groups of other bachelors until they are old enough to challenge a breeding stallion.
When attacked by packs of hyenas or wild dogs a zebra group will huddle together with the foals in the middle while the stallion tries to ward them off.

Unlike the other zebra species, Grévy's zebras do not have permanent social bonds.
A group of these zebras rarely stays together for more than a few months.
The foals stay with their mothers, while adult males live alone.
Like the other two zebra species, bachelor male zebras will organize in groups.

Like horses, zebras sleep standing up, and only sleep when neighbors are around to warn them of predators.
