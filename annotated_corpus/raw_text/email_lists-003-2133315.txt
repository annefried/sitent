Yes, I think that's exactly right.  We can probably adjust the comment in the .pinerc for now.  In the long term the .pinerc needs a lot of good error checking.  It just hasn't been done because limited resources.

Hi Laurence - 

Perhaps all that is needed is a list in the system .pinerc file of all the valid charsets, and not let the user set her charset to one that is not i n the list.  So, perhaps Pine could have US-ASCII, ISO-2022-JP, and the various ISO-8859-x sets wired in as an initial list, and the system file specify additional valid sets? 

The concern is to avoid letting users do things like set it to things such as ``Latin-1'' or ``ASCII'' or similar bogons... 

What do you think?
