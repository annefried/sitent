My company has been severely damaged by $50 billion (revenues)Texas based company 1) refusal to pay  monies owed under a contract. 
2)
misrepresenting information used to calculate amounts owed under the contract 3) appears to have instigated an FBI investigation of our company regarding a pending civil and regulatory dispute. 

I am looking for an introduction to Joe Jamail by someone who knows him. We need an attorney with the courage, confidence, and track record to successfully pursue our claim against a powerful adversary. 

Thank You.
