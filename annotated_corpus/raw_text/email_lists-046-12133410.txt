Regarding the naming of subexpressions I'd like to point out two slightly differing kinds of subexpression/expression naming relevant to producing speech. 

In AsTeR, you could name a cross-referencable object such as an equation with meaningful names e.g. Fibonacci's  formula instead of equation 1.13 --this made listening to cross-referenced material easier. See http://www.cs.cornell.edu/Info/People/raman/current/phd-thesis/html/node11. html#SECTION00162000000000000000 

AsTeR also performed the other kind of sub-expression naming which I think got discussed yesterday during the meeting. I refered to this in AsTeR as "variable substitution". --"folding" to use Dave's terminology-- AsTeR also implemented a fairly straight-forward naming algorithm for giving meaningful names to sub-expressions e.g. "lower constraint 1" and denominator 3" etc. 

The problem of recognizing that two subexpressions are identical is actually very hard if you're working with a written/typeset document --AsTeR did not attempt to do this. However, even without the intelligence to recognize two semantically equivalent instances of a  subexpression, "variable substitution" or "folding" as Dave refers to it in his minutes is *really* useful for speech and I suspect it would be very useful for small visual displays. 

In fact after I implemented the variable substitution  in AsTeR Rich Zippel at Cornell pointed out that symbolic math systems in the early 70's had to implement something analogous to display complex expressions since the displays available at the time were not as graphically rich as what we have today.
