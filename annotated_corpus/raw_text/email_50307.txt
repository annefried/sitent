Dear guys 

Having been out of the office for a couple of days, I've found myself the victim of theft (again).  This time my desk drawer key has been stolen from its "hiding place" under my telephone.  I *always* lock my drawers and keep the key in the same place, but on arriving in the office today I found the drawers unlocked, and the key missing.  Although there's nothing sensitive on or around my desk, I'm concerned about the security implications of someone sniffing around the office in this manner.  I also found the papers on my desk extensively reshuffled last week. 

Last year, in our old office, I had my only two real options books stolen from among the many and varied books on my desk.  That couldn't have been a random theft, and I fear this isn't either.  I can't understand who'd be so interested in a Research guy's belongings! 

Can we ask security to check their surveillance footage for any suspicious activity around my desk? 

Cheers, Steve
