While reading the discussion between Bruce Smith and Ron Whitney, I have come to the conclusion that the plug-in solution will not work, because we need the possibility of anchor's within math, and math in text in math. I'd like to see what you all think about this, since this is what Dave proposed e.g. at the DLI Math meeting in Illinois. 

I agree that today's plug-in api's are inadequate and am working to get this fixed. You can however make anchors within plugins work. The plugin is passed mouse events and can in turn call back to the browser to display a URL. This is enough to allow anchor's within math, and math in text in math, with the burden placed on the plugin.
