Per our conversation on coordination of our efforts on California and other jurisdictions, we have developed the following training program: 

1.    Anti-trust -- we have completed anti-trust training in Houston for traders and have scheduled it in Portland and Calgary. 

2.    Sales Practices -- this training has been completed in Portland and is being scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

3.    Anti-manipulation -- this training has been completed in Portland, but needs to be expanded to cover local law manipulation issues.  It also needs to be scheduled in Houston and Calgary. 

Also, the above training needs to be supplemented with training on local power pool rules.  There is a similar program being prepared in London.  A meeting is being scheduled so we can discuss these matters further.
