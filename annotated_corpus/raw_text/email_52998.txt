Ms. Crenshaw, 

Thank you very much for the message. I am very interested in the opportunity to talk to personnel from the Research Group at Enron. Between the two days you suggest, I prefer Wednesday 12/6. Considering the two-hour time difference between California and Texas, 11:00 am Pacific time (1:00 pm your time) seems to be a good slot. However, I am open most of the day on 12/6 so if some other time slot is prefered on your end, please let me know. 

Thanks again. I look forward to talking to you and your colleagues.
