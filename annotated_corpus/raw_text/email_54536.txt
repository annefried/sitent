Wade, 

Thanks for your help. Krishna advised me of the conversation he had with you.

Vince, I will certainly try. I am not optimistic primarily because this is handled out of Chennai, as it must since the parents are residents of Andhra Pradesh. Our earlier requests for visas from Chennai have been a very mixed bag, with us being turned down more often than not. The fact of the matter is that the visa officers in the respective consulates have incredible amounts of discretion and ability to say no. Once they say no, it is very difficult to reverse. 

But I will go through our good contacts at the US Consulate in Mumbai, as this has had more success than us speaking directly to Chennai.

Wade, 

I am writing to ask you to help my associate, Krishnarao Pinnamaneni, who faces a very difficult personal situation. You probably remember Krishna from his visits to our Bombay office when he was helping you on a few projects. 

A brief outline of the facts. 

1. His wife is pregnant. She gave birth to their daughter, Pallavi, a few years ago after a very complicated pregnancy. Pallavi was a premature child and her survival was a miracle (we all thank the Almighty for this wonderful child). Current pregnancy is also very complicated. 

2. Krishna invited his in-laws to visit and stay with them to care for his wife. The application for a tourist  visa was denied and the reason given for the denial was that they had overstayed the term of the visa during the previous  visit. The irony is that they complied with the US laws: they had asked for an extension of the visa and the extension was granted. 

The company can, of course, intervene on Krishna's behalf. Krishna made an outstanding contribution to Enron (he is currently a VP) and to the American society. I am sure that Ken Lay would have no objections to write a letter on his behalf to the State Department. 

I would prefer, however, to try informal channels first to avoid confrontational approach. It may be better for all the involved in the long-run. 

I hope you can use your personal contacts to intervene on Krishna's behalf and ask for a reversal of the decision on humanitarian grounds. I shall fax to you a copy of the decision. 

Thanks. 

Vince
