I haven't followed this discussion, but Pine does do a few things with character sets.  For example if you set Pine to use ISO-8859-1 and send an all ASCII message it will tag it US-ASCII (instead of ISO-8859-1).  Also, it's smart enough to display the lower 128 for all incoming messages in the ISO-8859-X characters sets and greek the ones it can't if the character set of the receiving Pine is US-ASCII or ISO-8859-X.  Thought that was what required for minimal MIME compliance. 

Hope I haven't upgraded the sin from omission to comision....

Thanks for your comments.  You needn't convince me; I've been involved with the MIME charset issue for a long time (you'll note that I am one of the authors of the ISO-2022-JP spec).  In defense of the other Pine team members, the sin is one of omission rather than of comission; they wanted to do something about character sets and didn't want to wire in a table of legal values (since it might change). 

I've suggested that as a first pass the charset should only be settable in the system config file, and that the charset always be coerced to US-ASCII unless the text contains 8-bit characters and/or has ``funny'' control characters such as ESC or SI/SO.  More work would definitely be needed in thi s area, but you'll appreciate that there are other, higher priorities just now...
