Jeff and  Steve 

As you requested, I have  prepared a list of my preferred public policy contacts for  California.  It is composed of professionals from an array of public,  private and non-profit backgrounds.  I have worked in some capacity  with each of these people and most I know quite well. 

Please call me for further  background.
