The Ayoreo (Ayoreode, Ayoréo, Ayoréode) are an indigenous people of the Gran Chaco.
They live in an area surrounded by the Paraguay, Pilcomayo, Parapetí, and Grande Rivers, spanning both Bolivia and Paraguay.
Ayoreo combine hunter-gatherer lifestyle with farming, depending on the season of the year.
There are records about a kind of shamanism (nainai, shaman).

==Name==
The Ayorea people are known by numerous names including Ayoré, Garaygosode, Guarañoca, Guidaigosode, Koroino, Moro, Morotoco, Poturero, Pyeta Yovai, Samococio, Sirákua, Takrat, Totobiegosode, and Yanaigua.

==Language==
They speak the Ayoreo language, which is classified under Zamucoan, a small language family of Paraguay and Bolivia.
A grammar and dictionary have been published for the language, and 20% of the Ayoreo are literate.
Tsiracua is a dialect of Ayoreo.

==History==
There are several subgroups, for example Totobiegosode were isolated, but many of them have been eventually relocated forcibly, while some remnants still keep avoiding contact.
Some groups still live uncontacted (or in voluntary isolation), being the only extant uncontacted tribes in South America not living in the Amazon.
The Ayoreo are threatened by deforestation.

In 2010, an expedition in search of new species of plants and insects, organised by the Natural History Museum in London, was suspended when concerns were raised that Ayoreo people might be encountered and disturbed.

==Political representation==
In Bolivia, the Ayoreo people are represented by the organization CANOB (Central Ayoreo Nativo del Oriente Boliviano).
In 2002 an Ayoreo organization was founded in Paraguay, UNAP (Unión Nativa Ayoreo del Paraguay).
CANOB has its main office in Santa Cruz de la Sierra whilst UNAP has its headquarters at the frontier between the Campo Loro and Ebetogué regions.
