Thank you Harald.  MIME is MIME is MIME.  And if it violates the RFC it isn't MIME and shouldn't pretend to be. 

That was the point of my original cryptic comment.  Now PLEASE edit my address out of the headers of this.  And probably all of those other mailinglists and limit to pine-info.  PLEASE. 

Thankyou.
