I just heard about this bill by La Seur 

ABX1 70 attempts to criminalize acts of unregulated generators if they perform maintenance at times other than the California Public Utilities Commission requires. Further, the commission is required to allow scheduled maintenance of only one generator at a time. So, with 500 generators in the state, just how  many years would it take to complete one round of maintenance?  Also, please note it does not apply to munis.
