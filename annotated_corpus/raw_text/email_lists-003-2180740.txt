Borka, Hi! I'd like to request that the scheduling for the Character Set BOF be done so that it does not conflict with any of the other information service working groups (IIIR, IDS, OSI-DS, URI, for example) as I and I suspect most of the information service people feel we *need* to attend this BOF. The interest will be quite high, I think. Thanks for getting this together. Chris Weider Merit Network, Inc. Chair, IIIR Co-chair, IDS
