Rick Troth writes: Plain text  is defined differently from system to system. On UNIX,  plain text is ASCII (now ISO-8859-1) with lines delimited by NL (actually LF).   On NT,  plain text is 16 bits wide  (so I hear). That ain't ASCII,  though we could be the high-order 8 bits for much of plain text processing,  and that's fine by me.   (memory is cheap) On VM/CMS,  plain text is EBCDIC (now CodePage 1047) and records are handled by the filesystem out-of-band of the data,  so NL (and LF and CR) aren't sacred characters.   Now ... "mail is plain-text,  not ASCII". 

Please, gentlemen.....read the RFC. As long as you send mail over the Internet, claiming MIME compatibility, the bits on the wire have to conform to the MIME convention, *NOT* to the local convention, whatever that is. 

The omission of a character set label from text/plain MEANS THAT THE CHARACTER SET IS US ASCII. 

A message that contains characters with the high bit set CANNOT BE US-ASCII, and therefore, a text/plain message without a charset= label in it that has such characters IS NOT LEGAL MIME. So, when SMTP strips the 8th bit, it gets what it deserves. 

This was ******NOT******* an oversight. This was deliberate design, designed to promote interoperability. The proliferation of mail in strange character sets without labels is *exactly* one of the things that the MIME effort was meant to *remove*. 

End of flame..............if you want a couple of tons more, read the archives of the SMTP and RFC-822 groups. The last flareup is hidden under "unknown-7bit" and "unknown-8bit" discussions.
