From first reading, it appears that the step of "parsing embellishments" e.g. superscripts, accents etc needs to happen *before* the operator precedence parsing step. 

Also, this will allow us to handle complex expressions appearing as embellishments to other complex expressions correctly. 

Mathematica's parsing, which works in a manner similar to what Bruce describes, has no problem handling complex embellishments as in your example. Perhaps I am too familar with the algorithm and that I filled in pieces missing in Bruce's description, but I didn't see anything wrong with his description.  Do you have a (simple) example in mind where it fails?
