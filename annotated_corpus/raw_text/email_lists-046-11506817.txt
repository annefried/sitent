subject="small questions regarding integrals"
To: w3c-math-erb@w3.org

In composing a longer piece about concerns here, I have a couple of smallish, focused questions.  I'll ask them in the context of integrals. 

Dave proposes something on the order of 

integral from ... to ... of ... \d x 

for an "ordinary" integral. 

1. How will we handle the variants on this theme such as multiple integrals (to be rendered with multiple integral signs), path integrals, etc. ? 

2. Is there a specific reason we don't want to use the TeX-like notation: \int_{...}^{...} ... ?  (because the _ and ^ operators become "too" overloaded?)
