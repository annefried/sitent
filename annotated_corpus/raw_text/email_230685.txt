Michelle and Peter, we (GSP) have determined that we are not a federal government contractor.  Based on feedback from GSP employees, we do sell newsprint to printers who print material for the federal government, but we are a 'second-tier' contractor, not a 'first-tier' contractor.  (Pat McCarthy, the local employment law attorney that I have been using, used these terms when David Howe and i talked to him today.)  Pat informed us that second-tier contractors do not have to abide by all the federal government requirements for contractors. 

Based on this, GSP does not plan to file EEO-1 reports or prepare affirmative action plans.  In addition, we do not feel that we are subject to an OFCCP audit. 

Michelle, since you left me the voicemail telling me that we are not included in the Enron EEO-1, i assume that also means that Enron's status as a government contractor does not force us to prepare EEO-1 and AAPs. 

Please advise us if you feel we have made incorrect assumptions on any of this.
