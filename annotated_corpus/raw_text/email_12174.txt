I genuinely believed in Enron and the Values of the company 

You demonstrated that that trust was misplaced and worth nothing 

I particularly like your adherance to the core values - you "respected" us, you "communicated" brilliantly with us, your fucking us over was "excellent", your "integrity" was without question 

You load of bastards - you screwed us all and got fat on the profits of our sweat 

I hope that the board and upper management rot in jail and never see the light of day again - apart from when you are exercising in the open prison yard in your shackles 

Just Another Fucked Over Ex-Employee
